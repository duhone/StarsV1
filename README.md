StarsV1
=======
written 1993 using Turbo C++ 3 for dos. 16 bit EGA graphics

Starfield simulator. My first c++ program. There was an even 
older version written in Pascal but I lost that code. Never got
around to adding terminate and stay resident code, so it was never
really a screensaver in dos, but that was the eventual goal.
